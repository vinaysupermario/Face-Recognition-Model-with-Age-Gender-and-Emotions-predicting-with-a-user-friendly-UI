# Face-Recognition-Model-with-Age-Gender-and-Emotions-predicting-with-a-user-friendly-UI
Using OpenCV and FER, wrote up a python program which can do age, gender, and emotional estimations of the face of a person both using photos or videos or even real time webcam.
Created website using Flask, PHP, HTML, CSS to create a UI which even a non-savvy person can use to upload photos and process the image for such datapoints, and store these results in MySQL database.
Created a search page, which can search for various results out of the captured datapoints from the files that have been processed before. For Ex: one can look photos for Female, in an age group of 25-37, which were looking surprised in their photos.
